## 🔍 Security Scope

### ✅ In Scope

We're interested in vulnerabilities affecting:

#### **Core Components**
- **MCP Server**: JSON-RPC implementation, protocol handling
- **Code Parsers**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python parsing vulnerabilities
- **Graph Engine**: AST processing and graph construction
- **File System Access**: Repository scanning and file reading
- **Memory Safety**: Rust memory safety violations

#### **Attack Vectors**
- **Malicious Repositories**: Crafted code that exploits parsing
- **MCP Protocol Abuse**: JSON-RPC injection or manipulation
- **Resource Exhaustion**: DoS through excessive resource consumption
- **Path Traversal**: Unauthorized file system access
- **Code Injection**: Through analysis of malicious code

### ❌ Out of Scope

The following are generally not considered security vulnerabilities:

- **Feature Requests**: Suggestions for new functionality
- **Performance Issues**: Unless they enable DoS attacks
- **Analysis Accuracy**: Incorrect code analysis results
- **Documentation Issues**: Errors in documentation
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Issues in upstream libraries (report to them directly)
- **Social Engineering**: Attacks against users, not the software

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### 🏢 For Organizations Using CodeCodePrism

#### **Network Security**
- Run CodeCodePrism in isolated environments when analyzing untrusted code
- Use appropriate firewall rules for MCP server deployments
- Monitor resource usage to detect potential DoS attacks

#### **Access Control**
- Limit repository access to necessary directories only
- Use least-privilege principles for service accounts
- Regular security audits of deployment configurations

#### **Data Protection**
- Ensure sensitive repositories are not exposed through MCP
- Regular backup of analysis data if stored persistently
- Encrypt sensitive configuration and communication channels

### 👨‍💻 For Developers Integrating CodeCodePrism

#### **Input Validation**
- Validate repository paths and file inputs
- Sanitize data passed to CodeCodePrism APIs
- Implement appropriate error handling

#### **Resource Management**
- Set reasonable timeouts for analysis operations
- Monitor memory and CPU usage
- Implement graceful degradation for large repositories
