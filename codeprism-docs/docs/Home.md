# Welcome to CodePrism

## What is CodePrism?

CodePrism is a production-ready, high-performance code intelligence server implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides AI assistants with structured understanding of codebases through graph-based analysis, enabling real-time, accurate code intelligence across multiple programming languages.

## AI-Driven Development

CodePrism is an AI-only development experiment where every component—code, documentation, tests, and configurations—is generated by AI agents. This approach demonstrates the potential of AI-driven software development while maintaining production-quality standards. **Note**: We do not accept human-written code contributions to preserve the integrity of this experiment.

## Core Capabilities

- **Comprehensive Analysis Tools**: Production-ready suite for code navigation, search & discovery, quality analysis, and workflow orchestration
- **Parser Development Toolkit**: Advanced debugging tools with AST visualization, validation, and performance profiling
- **Multi-Language Support**: Native support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python with extensible parser architecture
- **Graph-Based Intelligence**: Universal AST representation with relationship mapping and real-time updates
- **MCP Integration**: Seamless integration with AI assistants through standardized protocol

## Current Status

CodePrism is **production-ready** with comprehensive testing coverage and full MCP compliance. All analysis tools are verified working against real-world repositories with continuous integration ensuring reliability.

## Quick Start
