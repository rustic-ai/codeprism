# Welcome to CodePrism

## Introduction

CodePrism is a groundbreaking project that showcases the capabilities of AI-driven software development. It is a production-ready, high-performance code intelligence server implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP). CodePrism provides AI assistants with a structured understanding of codebases through graph-based analysis, enabling real-time, accurate code intelligence.

## AI-Only Development Experiment

This project is entirely AI-generated, with every line of code, documentation, test, and configuration written by AI agents. We do not accept human-written code contributions to maintain the integrity of this experiment.

## Key Features

- **20 Production-Ready Analysis Tools**: Including core navigation, search & discovery, advanced analysis, and workflow orchestration.
- **Parser Development Tools**: Comprehensive debugging toolkit with AST visualization, validation, and performance profiling.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python with advanced analysis capabilities.
- **Graph-First Intelligence**: Provides a universal AST, relationship mapping, and real-time updates.
- **Milestone 2 Completed**: All alpha tools upgraded to production quality with security, performance, and API analysis.

## Current Status

CodePrism is production-ready with **20 tools achieving a 100% success rate** and **425 comprehensive tests**. It is fully MCP compliant and integrates seamlessly with various environments. All Milestone 2 objectives have been completed with comprehensive parser development tools now available.
