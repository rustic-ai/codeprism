# Release Process for CodeCodePrism üöÄ

> **AI-Driven Releases**: Our unique automated release process powered by our AI developer

## ü§ñ Overview

CodeCodePrism uses a fully automated release process designed specifically for AI-driven development. Unlike traditional projects, our releases are generated, tested, and deployed entirely by our AI developer with minimal human intervention.

## üîÑ Release Types

### 1. **Automatic Releases** (Recommended)
- **Trigger**: Commits with conventional commit messages on `main`
- **Frequency**: As needed based on changes
- **Process**: Fully automated via GitHub Actions
- **Version**: Automatically determined by commit types

### 2. **Manual Releases** (Emergency/Special)
- **Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch
- **Use Cases**: Hotfixes, security patches, major milestones
- **Process**: AI-guided but human-initiated
- **Version**: Manually specified version bump

## üìã Conventional Commits

Our AI developer follows conventional commit format for automatic versioning:

```bash
# Patch release (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
fix: resolve parsing error with complex decorators
fix(parser): handle edge case in inheritance analysis

# Minor release (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0)  
feat: add Rust language parser support
feat(analysis): implement security vulnerability detection

# Major release (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0)
feat!: redesign MCP protocol interface
feat(api)!: change analysis result format

# Breaking change indicator
BREAKING CHANGE: analysis results now return structured objects
```
