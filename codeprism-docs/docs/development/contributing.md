# Contributing to CodePrism 🤖

> **Welcome to the first 100% AI-generated open source project!**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CodePrism! This project is unique - it's entirely generated and maintained by AI agents, with no human-written code accepted. But there are many exciting ways to contribute without writing a single line of code!

## 🚨 Important: No Code Contributions

**We do NOT accept:**
- Pull requests with code changes
- Human-written code in any form
- Direct modifications to source files
- Configuration changes (except documentation)

**Why?** This project is an experiment in pure AI-driven development. Every bit and byte must come from our AI developer to maintain the integrity of the experiment.
