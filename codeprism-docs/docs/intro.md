# Introduction to CodePrism

Welcome to the documentation for CodePrism, the world's first 100% AI-generated open source project.

CodePrism is a high-performance code intelligence server that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides AI assistants with a structured, graph-based understanding of codebases, enabling real-time, accurate code intelligence.

This documentation will guide you through the features, architecture, and usage of CodePrism. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate CodePrism into your workflow or a contributor interested in our unique AI-only development model, you'll find everything you need to get started.

## What Makes CodePrism Unique

### AI-Generated Architecture
Every component of CodePrism—from the core Rust engine to documentation—is generated by AI agents. This demonstrates the potential of AI-driven software development while maintaining production-quality standards.

### Graph-Based Intelligence
Unlike traditional code analysis tools that work with flat syntax trees, CodePrism builds a comprehensive graph representation of your codebase, capturing relationships between symbols, dependencies, and semantic concepts.

### MCP Integration
As a Model Context Protocol server, CodePrism provides standardized interfaces for AI assistants to understand and interact with codebases, enabling sophisticated code intelligence workflows.

## Core Components

### Code Analysis Engine
- **Universal AST**: Language-agnostic abstract syntax tree representation
- **Symbol Resolution**: Cross-language symbol linking and dependency tracking  
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understanding of code patterns, architecture, and relationships

### Parser Framework
- **Multi-Language Support**: Native parsers for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy addition of new language parsers
- **Development Tools**: Comprehensive debugging and validation toolkit

### MCP Server
- **23 Production Tools**: Complete suite for code navigation, analysis, and workflow
- **Real-Time Updates**: Incremental parsing and graph updates
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Direct compatibility with Claude, Cursor, VS Code, and others
