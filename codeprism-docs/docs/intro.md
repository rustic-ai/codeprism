# Welcome to CodePrism

**CodePrism** is a production-ready, high-performance code intelligence server implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides AI assistants with structured understanding of codebases through graph-based analysis, enabling real-time, accurate code intelligence across multiple programming languages.

## 🤖 AI-Driven Development

CodePrism represents a groundbreaking AI-only development experiment where every component—code, documentation, tests, and configurations—is generated by AI agents. This approach demonstrates the potential of AI-driven software development while maintaining production-quality standards.

:::info AI-Only Development
We do not accept human-written code contributions to preserve the integrity of this experiment. However, documentation improvements and community feedback are welcome!

## 🌟 What Makes CodePrism Unique

### 🔗 Graph-Based Intelligence
Unlike traditional code analysis tools that work with flat syntax trees, CodePrism builds a comprehensive graph representation of your codebase, capturing relationships between symbols, dependencies, and semantic concepts.

### 🔌 MCP Integration
As a Model Context Protocol server, CodePrism provides standardized interfaces for AI assistants to understand and interact with codebases, enabling sophisticated code intelligence workflows.

### ⚡ Production-Ready Performance
Built for enterprise use with comprehensive testing, real-time updates, and multi-language support.
