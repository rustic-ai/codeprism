# Introduction to CodePrism

Welcome to the documentation for CodePrism, the world's first 100% AI-generated open source project.

CodePrism is a high-performance code intelligence server that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides AI assistants with a structured, graph-based understanding of codebases, enabling real-time, accurate code intelligence.

This documentation will guide you through the features, architecture, and usage of CodePrism. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate CodePrism into your workflow or a contributor interested in our unique AI-only development model, you'll find everything you need to get started.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
