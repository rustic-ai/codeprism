Each new tool category can be developed independently while leveraging the existing:
- **Graph-based code representation**
- **Multi-language parser framework**  
- **MCP protocol implementation**
- **Resource and prompt systems**

## Conclusion

The CodePrism MCP server is **production-ready** for immediate use. Future enhancements will focus on expanding analysis capabilities based on real-world usage patterns and community feedback.

The current 23 tools provide a solid foundation for:
- ✅ **Code exploration and navigation**
- ✅ **Architecture understanding**  
- ✅ **Dependency analysis**
- ✅ **Python-specific metaprogramming analysis**
- ✅ **Workflow orchestration and automation**

Future development will be **community-driven** and **use-case specific** rather than speculative feature development.
