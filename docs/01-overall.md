Large-language-model assistants can now reason over hundreds of thousands of tokens, so the bottleneck for "talk to my codebase" has shifted from *window size* to *getting the *right* bytes into the window*.  By combining (1) a **polyglot call/data-flow graph** that is kept fresh with Tree-Sitter's incremental parsing, and (2) an **MCP-compliant server** that streams just-in-time snippets and graph paths, you can let engineers chat with, navigate and even regenerate huge multi-repo systems without ever bulk-indexing or vector-embedding the source.  This design borrows Cline's "structure-first, no index" philosophy while staying compatible with the growing MCP ecosystem used by tools like Cursor, Replit, Codeium and Claude Desktop.

## 1. Why not just build a giant vector index?

Traditional RAG pipelines split files into embeddings, but code "chunks" sever the control- and data-flow a developer actually cares about, decay as the repo changes, and create new security surfaces for IP-rich source — exactly the issues Cline highlights.  Sourcegraph's Cody, for example, rebuilds a vector index continuously to mitigate drift, yet still warns that retrieval quality drives answer quality.  Recent tutorials on RAG-for-code show how complex that pipeline becomes.

## 2. Lessons from Cline's structure-first approach

Cline starts by walking the AST to list the *definitions* in a project and then follows imports and call sites on demand instead of bulk-reading every file.  That yields:

* **Relevance** – the assistant only sees files connected by actual edges.
* **Freshness** – no index rebuild; it just re-parses the file that changed.
* **Privacy** – no embeddings of proprietary code leave the machine.

## 3. Why MCP is the right plumbing

Anthropic's Model Context Protocol standardises how a tool can offer *Resources* (text blobs like snippets) and *Tools* (functions like "trace_path") over JSON-RPC.  Cursor already uses MCP so an IDE can attach external context servers with a single config line.  The protocol supports local *stdio* or remote *SSE* transports, capability negotiation, resource subscriptions and explicit user-consent flows — ideal for an enterprise code graph.  Industry momentum is strong: Verge reported early adoptions by Replit, Codeium and Sourcegraph when MCP launched.

## 4. Proposed architecture

### 4.1 Components

| Layer                            | Tech & duties                              | Key points                                                                                                      | Citations |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **G-Core (graph builder)**       | Rust/Go workers + **Tree-Sitter** grammars | Builds/updates a universal AST and patches only changed regions in ≈150 ms                                      |           |
| **Graph store**                  | Neo4j / TypeDB                             | Stores nodes (`Function`, `Route`, `SQLQuery`) and edges (`CALLS`, `WRITES`, `EMITS`) queryable with **Cypher** |           |
| **G-MCP Server**                 | Thin TypeScript/Python service             | Implements MCP endpoints:<br>  `resources/list`, `resources/read`, `tools/trace_path`, `tools/explain_node`     |           |
| **Host (IDE / Claude / Cursor)** | Any MCP-aware client                       | Chooses graph paths & snippets, builds the prompt, optionally writes patches back via Git APIs                  |           |

### 4.2 Data flow

```
save file ─▶ G-Core parses diff ─▶ graph patch
                          ▲               │
   tools/trace_path <─────┘               │
        │                                 ▼
   Host asks LLM ▷ snippets + path ▷ reasoning ▷ updated code suggestion
```

## 5. Chat-loop user experience

1. **Ask**: "Why does *CheckoutView\.swift* throw `TotalsMismatch`?"
2. **LLM calls tool** `trace_path {from: node://CheckoutView.swift#129, to: node://TotalsMismatch}`.
3. **Server** returns the shortest call/data path plus file-range URIs.
4. **Host** downloads those snippets, assembles a prompt and the model explains the flow.
5. **Follow-up**: "Refactor the Python handler so totals never desync." The assistant inserts/edit patches, commits via Git tool, and G-Core's watcher instantly refreshes the graph.

Every step uses MCP's explicit-approval model, so no code leaves the dev box unless the user okays it.

## 6. Advantages & trade-offs

| ✅ Benefits                                                      | ❌ Challenges                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Language-agnostic via Tree-Sitter's 50+ grammars.               | Dynamic/reflection heavy code may elude static parsing.                       |
| Zero embeddings: nothing to leak, nothing to drift.             | Graph size can explode in monorepos → need edge pruning & sharding.           |
| Near-real-time updates; no nightly index jobs.                  | Cross-lang linking (e.g., REST path ↔ controller) requires heuristic linkers. |
| Plug-and-play with any MCP host (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.). | MCP is young; client UX patterns are still evolving.                          |

## 7. Implementation roadmap

1. **Phase 1 – MVP Foundation**

   * Add JS/TS, Python, Java grammars.
   * Stream patches into a single-node Neo4j.
   * Expose `trace_path` & `snippet` tools over stdio MCP.

2. **Phase 2 – Cross-language linkers**

   * REST/GraphQL route matcher, SQL string extractor.

3. **Phase 3 – IDE & Claude plugins**

   * VS Code panel; prompt templates for "explain path", "guard with errors".

4. **Phase 4 – Scale**

   * Shard graph by repo, compress rarely-used edges.
   * Add caching layer to MCP server; use `resources/subscribe` for live updates.

## 8. Positioning vs indexing-centric assistants

* **Cody** still relies on vector search and continuous re-indexing, which works but adds operational overhead.
* **RAG tutorials** highlight the complexity of chunking, embedding and syncing large repositories.
* **Cline** and this design instead embrace large windows and structured exploration, delivering higher semantic fidelity at the cost of a few hundred extra tokens per query — a trade-off that's acceptable with modern 200-400 k context models.

### Key takeaway

A *graph-first, MCP-served* assistant marries Cline's structure-aware traversal with Anthropic's open protocol, giving developers an interactive, always-current map of their system while keeping code private and operationally simple.  As context windows and model reasoning improve, this architecture scales naturally—just stream the next hop down the graph.
