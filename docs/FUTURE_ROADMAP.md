## Implementation Priorities

### High Priority (If Requested)
1. **Additional Language Support** - Rust and Java parsers
2. **Code Quality Tools** - Duplicate detection and unused code analysis
3. **Security Analysis** - Basic vulnerability scanning

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Analysis Tools** - Bottleneck detection
2. **Advanced Architecture Analysis** - Design pattern analysis
3. **CI/CD Integration** - Pipeline integration

### Low Priority
1. **Advanced Reporting** - Dashboard and analytics
2. **IDE Integrations** - Editor plugins
3. **Advanced AI Features** - ML-powered analysis

## Contributing

The current 18-tool implementation provides comprehensive code analysis capabilities. Future enhancements will be driven by:

- **User feedback** and specific use case requirements
- **Community contributions** and feature requests  
- **Integration needs** with specific development workflows
- **Language ecosystem** support requirements

### Contribution Areas
- **New language parsers** using the extensible parser framework
- **Additional analysis algorithms** for quality and security tools
- **Integration adapters** for CI/CD and development tools
- **Documentation and examples** for specific use cases

## Architecture for Extensions

The current modular architecture supports easy extension:

```
tools/
├── core/          # Navigation and repository operations  
├── search/        # Content and symbol discovery
├── analysis/      # Code quality and complexity analysis
├── workflow/      # Orchestration and batch processing
└── quality/       # [Future] Quality analysis tools
└── security/      # [Future] Security analysis tools
└── performance/   # [Future] Performance analysis tools
```

Each new tool category can be developed independently while leveraging the existing:
- **Graph-based code representation**
- **Multi-language parser framework**  
- **MCP protocol implementation**
- **Resource and prompt systems**

## Conclusion

The CodeCodePrism MCP server is **production-ready** for immediate use. Future enhancements will focus on expanding analysis capabilities based on real-world usage patterns and community feedback.

The current 18 tools provide a solid foundation for:
- ✅ **Code exploration and navigation**
- ✅ **Architecture understanding**  
- ✅ **Dependency analysis**
- ✅ **Python-specific metaprogramming analysis**
- ✅ **Workflow orchestration and automation**

Future development will be **community-driven** and **use-case specific** rather than speculative feature development.
