# Git Hooks - Implementation Completeness Enforcement

This project uses git hooks to automatically enforce code quality standards and prevent incomplete implementations from being committed.

## Pre-commit Hook Overview

The `.git/hooks/pre-commit` script automatically runs comprehensive validation before every commit:

### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Implementation Completeness Check**
- Blocks commits with `TODO`/`FIXME` comments
- Prevents `unimplemented!()`/`todo!()` macros
- Catches placeholder implementations and stub code
- Warns about ignored tests that might hide incomplete work

### ‚úÖ **Step 2: Compilation Check**
- Ensures all code compiles with `cargo check`

### ‚úÖ **Step 3: Code Formatting**
- Validates Rust code formatting with `cargo fmt`

### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Linting**
- Runs Clippy with zero warnings policy

### ‚úÖ **Step 5: Unit Tests**
- Executes all unit tests to ensure functionality

### ‚úÖ **Step 6: Documentation Tests**
- Validates code examples in documentation

### ‚úÖ **Step 7: Documentation Build**
- Builds Docusaurus documentation (if present)

### ‚úÖ **Step 8: Integration Tests**
- Runs integration tests (if present)

## How It Works

The pre-commit hook runs automatically when you execute `git commit`. If any validation fails, the commit is blocked with clear error messages:

```bash
# Normal commit - hooks run automatically
git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication"

# Example output when implementation completeness check fails:
üîç Step 1/8: Implementation Completeness Check
‚ùå COMMIT BLOCKED: Found TODO/FIXME/placeholder code

Found prohibited patterns:
src/auth.rs:42:    // TODO: Implement password hashing
src/user.rs:156:   unimplemented!("Add user validation")

Fix all issues above before committing.
```

## Implementation Completeness Rules

### ‚ùå **Prohibited Patterns (Blocks Commits)**
- `TODO` or `FIXME` comments
- `unimplemented!()` or `todo!()` macros
- Placeholder implementations or stub functions
- `assert!(true)` placeholder tests
- Comments like "For now", "Placeholder would", etc.

### ‚úÖ **Acceptable Patterns**
```rust
// ‚úÖ Development-only features
#[cfg(feature = "development")]
fn mock_function() { ... }

// ‚úÖ Explicit future work with GitHub issues
// NOTE: Feature XYZ not implemented - tracked in Issue #123

// ‚úÖ Dead code with clear attribution
#[allow(dead_code)] // Will be used in Issue #456
```

## Bypassing Hooks (Emergency Only)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Use only in extreme emergencies:**

```bash
# Skip all pre-commit validation (NOT RECOMMENDED)
git commit -m "emergency fix" --no-verify

# Disable hook permanently (NOT RECOMMENDED)
chmod -x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Hook Maintenance

### Updating the Implementation Completeness Check

The completeness check logic is in `scripts/check-implementation-completeness.sh`. To modify what patterns are detected:

1. Edit `scripts/check-implementation-completeness.sh`
2. Test the script: `./scripts/check-implementation-completeness.sh`
3. Commit changes (the hook will validate itself)

### Adding New Validation Steps

To add new validation to the pre-commit hook:

1. Edit `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
2. Add your validation step following the existing pattern
3. Update step numbers accordingly
4. Test by running `git commit` on a test change

## Rationale

This strict enforcement prevents the issues discovered in our MCP Test Harness audit:
- 60%+ of "completed" features were actually placeholder implementations
- 50+ TODO comments in supposedly finished code
- Systematic pattern of marking stub code as complete work

By catching these issues at commit time, we ensure:
- ‚úÖ Every commit contains functional, complete implementations
- ‚úÖ No placeholder code enters the repository
- ‚úÖ High code quality maintained consistently
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline reliability

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running
```bash
# Check if hook is executable
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Make executable if needed
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Script Not Found Error
```bash
# Ensure the implementation completeness script exists and is executable
ls -la scripts/check-implementation-completeness.sh
chmod +x scripts/check-implementation-completeness.sh
```

### Performance Issues
If the hook is too slow, you can temporarily skip expensive checks:
```bash
# Skip tests for quick commits (use sparingly)
SKIP_TESTS=1 git commit -m "docs: update README"
```

Add this to the hook script to support the `SKIP_TESTS` environment variable if needed.

## Support

The git hooks approach provides:
- **No External Dependencies**: Works with any git installation
- **Project-Specific**: Automatically available when repository is cloned
- **Integrated Workflow**: Seamlessly integrates with existing development process
- **Clear Feedback**: Detailed error messages with fix suggestions
- **Performance**: Fast execution with comprehensive validation
