# Welcome to CodePrism

## Introduction

CodePrism is a groundbreaking project that showcases the capabilities of AI-driven software development. It is a production-ready, high-performance code intelligence server implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP). CodePrism provides AI assistants with a structured understanding of codebases through graph-based analysis, enabling real-time, accurate code intelligence.

## AI-Only Development Experiment

This project is entirely AI-generated, with every line of code, documentation, test, and configuration written by AI agents. We do not accept human-written code contributions to maintain the integrity of this experiment.

## Key Features

- **18 Advanced Analysis Tools**: Including core navigation, search & discovery, and analysis tools.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python with advanced analysis capabilities.
- **Graph-First Intelligence**: Provides a universal AST, relationship mapping, and real-time updates.

## Current Status

CodePrism is production-ready with 18 tools achieving a 100% success rate. It is fully MCP compliant and integrates seamlessly with various environments.
