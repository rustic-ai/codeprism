# Rust Parser Documentation Update Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all the documentation updates made to add Rust language parser support to the prism project, enabling self-analysis of the prism codebase itself.

## 🎯 Goal: Self-Analysis Capability

**Primary Objective**: Enable prism to analyze its own Rust source code for:
- Architecture understanding and documentation
- Code quality assessment and improvement opportunities  
- Dependency analysis and refactoring guidance
- Performance optimization insights
- Ultimate "dogfooding" validation of prism capabilities

## 📋 Files Updated

**Impact**: Technical documentation reflects new language support priorities and current implementation status.

### 6. **docs/PRISM-MCP-SERVER-DESCRIPTION.md** (MCP Capabilities)
**Updated**:
- Added Rust to supported languages section:
  - "🚧 Rust (next priority - self-analysis capability)"

**Impact**: MCP server documentation includes Rust parser in capability descriptions.

### 7. **docs/RUST_PARSER_IMPLEMENTATION.md** (NEW)
**Created comprehensive implementation guide**:
- **6-week implementation roadmap**
- **Detailed technical specifications**
- **Rust-specific challenges and solutions**
- **Complete crate structure and dependencies**
