# Separation of Concerns Restructuring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the major restructuring work done to improve separation of concerns and maintain proper layered architecture in the Prism project.

## Problems Identified

### 1. MCP Server Overloaded with Analysis Logic
- **Issue**: The MCP server (`prism-mcp`) contained language-agnostic analysis code that should be in a separate module
- **Examples**: Complexity analysis, duplicate detection, security analysis, performance analysis
- **Impact**: Poor separation of concerns, difficult to reuse analysis logic

### 2. Python-Specific Analysis in Wrong Location
- **Issue**: Python-specific analysis (metaclass, decorator, inheritance) was mixed in the MCP server
- **Examples**: Metaclass impact analysis, decorator pattern detection, inheritance hierarchy analysis
- **Impact**: Language-specific logic not properly encapsulated

### 3. Missing Dedicated Analysis Layer
- **Issue**: No dedicated layer for code analysis functionality
- **Impact**: Analysis logic scattered across different modules

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created New Analysis Crate (`prism-analysis`)

**Location**: `crates/prism-analysis/`

**Purpose**: Language-agnostic code analysis tools

**Modules**:
- `complexity.rs` - Code complexity analysis (cyclomatic, cognitive, Halstead, maintainability)
- `duplicates.rs` - Code duplicate detection and similarity analysis
- `security.rs` - Security vulnerability detection
- `performance.rs` - Performance issue detection
- `api_surface.rs` - API surface analysis and documentation coverage

**Key Features**:
- Standalone analyzers that can be used independently
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Pattern-based analysis using regex
- Configurable thresholds and parameters
- Detailed recommendations for improvements

### 2. Enhanced Python Parser with Analysis (`prism-lang-python`)

**New Module**: `crates/prism-lang-python/src/analysis.rs`

**Purpose**: Python-specific code analysis

**Key Features**:
- **Decorator Analysis**: Framework-specific decorators (Flask, Django, FastAPI, pytest, SQLAlchemy, Celery)
- **Metaclass Analysis**: Registry, Singleton, Attribute Injection, ORM metaclasses
- **Inheritance Analysis**: MRO calculation, diamond inheritance detection, mixin identification
- **Pattern Recognition**: Caching, validation, authorization, logging patterns

**Framework Support**:
- Flask route decorators
- Django view decorators  
- FastAPI endpoint decorators
- pytest fixtures
- SQLAlchemy events
- Celery tasks

### 3. Updated MCP Server Architecture

**Changes Made**:
- Added dependency on `prism-analysis` crate
- MCP server now orchestrates analysis rather than implementing it
- Focus on tool registration, request/response handling, and high-level coordination
- Removed language-agnostic analysis code from MCP server

**New Responsibilities**:
- Tool management and registration
- Request routing and response formatting
- Integration with language-specific analyzers
- High-level analysis orchestration

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Better Separation of Concerns
- **Analysis Layer**: Dedicated to code analysis functionality
- **Language Parsers**: Focused on language-specific parsing and analysis
- **MCP Server**: Focused on protocol handling and orchestration

### 2. Improved Reusability
- Analysis modules can be used independently of MCP server
- Language-specific analysis can be reused across different tools
- Clear interfaces between components

### 3. Enhanced Maintainability
- Smaller, focused modules are easier to maintain
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Better testability with isolated components

### 4. Easier Extensibility
- Adding new analysis types is straightforward
- Language-specific analysis can be extended independently
- New languages can follow the established patterns

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- MCP server tools now delegate to analysis crates
- Some internal APIs have changed
- Analysis results may have slightly different formats

### Compatibility
- External MCP protocol remains unchanged
- Tool functionality is preserved
- Analysis accuracy is maintained or improved

## Conclusion

This restructuring significantly improves the project's architecture by:

1. **Establishing clear separation of concerns** between protocol handling, analysis, and language-specific functionality
2. **Creating reusable analysis components** that can be used independently
3. **Improving maintainability** through smaller, focused modules
4. **Enhancing extensibility** for future language and analysis support

The new architecture follows best practices for layered design and provides a solid foundation for future development.
